Relates to an article written on Medium:
https://medium.com/@t.surkiss/clean-your-api-calls-79d67098d258

Project example for faster writing, cleaner, and less bug-prone API call code.
The app is a working app. Fork freely to test the code ;)

The example uses:
* [Retrofit 2.0](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
* [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
